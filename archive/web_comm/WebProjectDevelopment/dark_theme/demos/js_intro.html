    //javascript statements - a set of instructions to be executed by the browser.
		console.log('Hello, I am a statement');
		//the above will print the statement
    
        //this is also a statement, declaring a variable called "x" with the keyword "var"
        //note, so far x has not been assigned a value.
        var x;
        //this should return undefined.
        console.log(x);
		//program - several statements executed line by line as they are written - js is a synchronous language
		var x = 5;
		var y = 6;
		var z = x + y;
		console.log('value from the program: ' + z);
		//this will print the sum of x and y to the screen, but the value will be converted to text, because it's going to push the type of the first variable onto the second

		//semicolon 1
		var a = 1;
		var b = 2;
		var c = a + b;
		console.log(c);

		//semicolon 2, whitespace, this can all go one one line with the semicolons there
		a = 5; b = 6; c=a+b;
		
		//JS whitespace = js is very liberal about the use of whitespace.  It's good practice ot put spaces between the operators


		//good practice - white space

		//line break
		//a good practice is not to have more than eight characters in a single line.  A newline should happen at the assignment operator or any operator

		//code blocks - functions
		//anything enclose in {} = these are to define statments to be executed together, for example, within a function

		function addTwoNumbers() {
			//define the code
			var x = 10;
			var y = 5;
			var z = x+y;
			console.log(z);
		}
		//then you actually have to call the function to get it to run
		addTwoNumbers();
    
    //Variables.
    
    //Variables are for storing unique values in memory.
	//declare a variable with the keyword var and the equals operator
	var a = 4;
	var b = 6;
	console.log(a);
	console.log(b);
	console.log(a + b);


	//primitive types:  number, string, boolean, etc.
	//variables have primitive types
	var myString = "This is a string.";
	var myNumber = 45;
	var pi = 3.1416;
	console.log (myString, myNumber, pi);

    //a string is a set of characters.  Strings are always typed in " ".  These may be single '' or double "".
    
    //a number is a number.  Numbers may have decimal points
    
    //a boolean is the value true or false.  
    
	//but typing in javascript is dynamic.  This means the "primitive type" of a variable can change by assigning it a different value
	var c = 'when b is added to me it will become a string.  Look at b:';

	//primitive types and dynamic types in javascript: 

	console.log(c + ' ' + b);//concatenate with "+""
	//the console will log the concatenation of these, making b into a string in the output

	//but this won't change the underlying type of b in memory
	console.log(b);

	//i can also change the primitive type of an already declared variable in memory to another kind of variable by reassingment
	a = '4';//assign a to the string 4
	console.log(a);

	//but since I changed the primitive type for a in memory, what do you think this will do?
	console.log(a + b);

	//i can also update the value of a variable without changing its type.  You will do this a lot in your programs, using variables to track the change in a specific value
	var pi = 3.142
	console.log(pi);

	//variables are designated by "identifiers" - which can contain letters, numbers, _, $.  But they cannot start with a number

	//try to run the statement below
	//var 1a = 5;

	//other conventions: camel casing, eg.  Here I am assigning firstName to the string bob.  I can still read firstName easily using camel casing.
	var firstName = "Bob";

	//we can also declare a bunch of variables in the same line separated by commas
	var newVariable = 6, LastName = "Smith";
	console.log(firstName + ' ' + LastName + ' ' + "is " + newVariable);

	//RESTRICTED KEYWORDS should not be used in variable names.  These are things like "this", if/else, do/while, etc.  

	
    
	//Data Types.  We've worked so far with mostly strings and numbers, but there are other primitive types in JS.
	//number
	var myNewNumber = 15;
	//string
	var text = "I'm a string";

	//boolean - true and false.  Whether a condition is true or false.
	var condition = true;
	console.log(condition);
	console.log(typeof condition);


	//array - a set of things.  Arrays have indexes (where a thing is in it), and these indexes start at 0.  That is, arrays have properties
	var myArray = ["one Thing", "another Thing", 5];
	console.log(myArray); //log the array
	console.log(typeof myArray); //arrays are objects!
	console.log(myArray.length); //how many things in this array?
	console.log(typeof myArray.length); //and what kind of data is this value?
	
	//we can also access different points in the array using the index value.  THE INDEX starts at 0
	console.log(myArray[0]);//log the value in the first poisiion
	console.log(typeof myArray[2]); //what type of data is in the third position?


	//and, finally objects!  A set, or array of key value pairs.  This is a fantastic and powerful way to STORE DATA!
	var myObject = {
		firstName: "John",
		lastName: "Doe",
		age: 25,
	}

	//we can parse through these objects.  
	console.log(myObject);
	console.log(myObject.age);
	console.log(typeof myObject); //it's an object
	console.log(typeof myObject.age); //it's a number
    
    //Operators.

	//to make variables, we've been using the assignment operator: "=".  Operators in javascript DO things.
	//I'm creating the variable a in memomry and assigning it a numerical value
	var a = 3;
	console.log(a);

	//because javascript is dynamically typed, I can re-assign a diferent value to a and change it's type
	var a = true;
	console.log(a);

	//Other operators are familiar ones from math, the arithmetic operators.
	// + operator adds numbers and concatenates strings
	var b = "Hello ";
	var c = "world!";
	var d = b + c;
	console.log(d);

	// also - , *,
	var x = 3;
	var y = 5;
	console.log(x+y);
	console.log(x-y);
	console.log(x*y);
	console.log(x/y);

	//also the modulo, which will divide x by y in this example, and give the remainder
	console.log(x%y);

	//increment operator ++ will increase the number by 1.
	console.log(x++);

	//decrement operator will decrease the number by 1.
	console.log(x--);


	//Assignment Operators.  There's really only one which is the =. But we can also combine it with other arithmetic operators
    //x has the value 3 (see line 173, above)
	var z = x; //assign the value of the new variable z to the value of x
    
    
    //combined with other operators.  Check the output to see how the value of z changes.
    
	z += x; // z = z + x; z = 3 + 3, or 6
		console.log(z);
	z -= x; // z = z - x; z = 6 - 3, or 3
		console.log(z);
	z *= x; // z = z * x; z = 3 * 3, or 9
		console.log(z);
	z /= x; // z = z / x; z = 9 / 3, or 3
		console.log(z);
	z %= x; // z = remainder of z/x; z = remainder(3/3) = 0
		console.log(z);

	//Comparison Operators.  compare two values, often used with if statements to check if a condition is true
    //create a variable called "evaluation" and assign it the output of the Comparison z == x, or is z equal to x
	var evaluation = z == x; //is z equal to x? this will give an output
    console.log('x equals: ' + x);
    console.log('z equals: ' + z);
	console.log('is z equal to x? ' + evaluation); //this should output false.

	
	//you can also see if things are not equal
    //the statement below evaluates whether z and x are not equal
	var newEvaluation = z != x;
	console.log(newEvaluation); //this should output true.

	//more comparison operators: 
    // === strict comparison - evaluates value AND type; eg, 3 is not equal to '3'
	// !== evaluates whether value and type are NOT equal
	// > greater than
	// < less than
	// >= greater than or equal to
	// <= less than or equal to

	//Logical Operators
	// &&: whether both conditions are true
	a = 3;
	b = 3;
	c = 3;
    //log the evaluation is a equal to b and b is equal to c?
	console.log (a == b && b == c);
    
    
	//this should evaluate to "true"
	// also or,  || 
    // is a equal to b OR b equal to c
	console.log(a==b || b==c);
    
    //is a not equal to b OR b not equal to c
	console.log(a!=b || b!=c);

	//Type Operators, check the typeof something - we've been using this above.
	var newString = "I'm a string";
	console.log(typeof a, typeof newEvaluation, typeof newString);
	//remember, you can always hold this evaluation, and any evaluation in a variable
	var whatType = typeof newString;
	console.log(whatType);
