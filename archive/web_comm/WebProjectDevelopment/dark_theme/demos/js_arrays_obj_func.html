    //Arrays
    //An array is a set of values stored under one variable.  They're enclosed by square braces, and each item is separated by a comma
    var colors = [
        'red',
        'blue',
        'green',
        'purple'];
    
    //note that the array does not have an ending comma.  Each value in an array has an "index value"
    //check the output in the console to see the result of the code on line 22
    console.log(colors[2]);//log the value at position 0 to the console.
    //the "index" of the array (the position of each value), like the "index" of a string, always starts at [0]
    
    //arrays, like strings, also have a "length" property.
    var numItems = colors.length;
    console.log(numItems);
    
    //Arrays can have more than one type of value.
    var randomArray = [
        'sandwiches'
        true,
        2.346
    ]
    
    //console.log the type of value in the second position of randomArray
   // console.log(typeof(randomArray[2]));
    
    //you can also access and update the values in the array using the index
    //randomArray[0] = 'dice';
    //console.log(randomArray);
    

    
    //Functions.
    //A function is a block of code, grouped and executed together to perform a specific task.  
    //basic syntax of declaring a function
    function myFunction() {
        document.getElementById("demo").textContent = "myFunction has run";
    }
    
    //you have to run a function; but because it has a name we can run it again.
    myFunction();
    
    //Javascript and other libraries come with embedded functions. We've used:
    // getElementById(), which is a function native to javascript for getting document elements.  It takes one parameter - the Id of the element you want to get.
    
    //some functions take parameters
    function calculateArea(width,height) {
       return width * height;
    }
    
    //run the function above with the parameters 4 and 12, and store that to the variable x
    var x = calculateArea(4,12);
    console.log(x); 

    //I could also add this to the document
    document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = calculateArea(10,2); 

    
    //Objects
    //javascript is an object-oriented language.  Most everything in javascript is actually an object or can act as an object.  The simplest way to understand objects is that they are a way to represent things in the world.  Objects have properties with values, and methods, which are functions that perform tasks or execute code specific to the function.  
    
    //creating the object "person" with an object literal notation.  Note that commas separate key value pairs.
    var person = {
        firstName: 'Joe',
        lastname: 'Smith',
        age: 33,
        hobbies: ['video games', 'crossword puzzles', 'wood working'],
        birthdayParty: function() {
            this.age++;//increment age by 1.  note the use of the "this" keyword here.  This refers to "this object"
        }
    }
    
    //check Joe's age
    console.log(person.age);
    //run the method on person
    person.birthdayParty();
    //console.log the new age by accesing the property using . notation
    console.log(person.age);
    console.log(person.firstName + " " + person.lastname + " " + "is " + person.age);
    
    //Objects and arrays allow you to store complex arrangements of data.
    //Arrays can be part of an object just like functions
    var student = {
        firstName: 'Jane',
        lastName: 'Doe',
        gradYear: 2020,
        courses: ['english','spanish','physics II','calculus']
    }
    console.log(student.courses[2]);
    
    //but looking at this, we might want to have more than one student, or more than one thing with these properties and methods
    //we can create these using object constructor notation, and then create multiple instances of objects, under different variables, with the same properties (though with different values) and methods.
   function course(name,location,time,maxStudents) {
       //note this is a function, so I am using ; to end statements
       this.name = name;
       this.location = location;
       this.time = time;
       this.maxStudents = maxStudents;
   }
    //now I can add values to the properties of this by passing them to the parameters
    var webDesign = new course('web design','Smith 324','12:30pm', 25);
    
    console.log(webDesign.time);
    
    var chemistry = new course('Chemistry 101','Friedl 114','1:25pm', 120);
    
    console.log(chemistry.location); 
    
    //Javascript is built for web design and execution in the browser.  So it also comes with a number of embedded objects with properties and methods.  Like the "document" object, and the "window" object
    //document.getElementById() - takes an "id" in the page as an argument, returns the element with that id
    //document.title - the title of the current document
    //document.URL - returns a string containing the URL of the current document.
