<h1>Stuff about strings</h1>

<p>Strings are sets of characters in javascript.  Like any other JS primitive element, a string is a kind of object.  This means they have some in-built properties and methods. Like the .length (an integer, the number of characters in a string), and many more.</p>
<br>
<p>W3 Schools has a page for <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp">strings</a> as well as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp">string methods</a>.</p>


<p>The length property returns the length of a string:</p>
<p>click the button below to find the length of the string "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" (the alphabet)</p>
<button id="demo" onclick="myFunction()">Click Here</button>
<br>
<p>As always, read this file with a text editor to see how the function in the button works</p>

<script>
	//click the button in the webpage to see what .length does
function myFunction(){
	var txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = txt.length;
}


//other methods:  

	//index of - find the place of a character or a string in a string
	var indexTxt = "where is the letter";
	//get the first appearance of the letter h.
	console.log(indexTxt.indexOf('h'));
	//this will return 1.  All indicies start at 0.
	//I could get that index value and store it in a variable
	var firstLetter = indexTxt.indexOf('h');

	//or the search method
	console.log(indexTxt.search('is'));


	var newText = "this is a new text we will look at to talk about slices, substrings, and other string methods";

	//.slice(start,end) - slice a string up.  This can also accept negative index values, going from the back of the string

	//.substring(start,end) - either two parameters, starting and ending index values, or with just one parameter, you can get the rest of the string

	//.substr(start,length) - the starting index value then *length* of the string you want

	//replace the contents of a string.  with .replace('string', 'string')
	var newNewText = newText.replace('a new', 'another new');

	console.log(newNewText);
	//and see the previous text is unaffected because we stored the new version as a different value
	console.log(newText);

	//you can also use regular expressions, here: '/a/g' replaces all 'a' in the text with '?''
	var text1 = newText.replace(/a/g, '?');
	console.log(text1);

	//or make strings lower or uppercase
	console.log(text1.toLowerCase());
	console.log(text1.toUpperCase());

	//or put two or more strings together
	var x = 'This is the first part';
	var y = 'joined to the second';
	var z = x.concat(y);
	console.log(z);

	//and make sure we add a space - .concat takes two parameters
	z = x.concat(' ', y);
	console.log(z);

	//find a character at a specific index value in a stirng
	console.log(x.charAt(0));
	console.log(y.charAt(0));

	//or get the unicode value at that index position
	console.log('the unicode value of T is ' + x.charCodeAt(0));

	//or, take the value of a string and put it in an array with spliit
	//here I'm using space as a splitting method.  You can use any character, or nothing.  Nothing input list.split(''), will give you an array of all of the characters in the string
	var list = 'Apple Banana Peach Plum Kiwi';
	var listArray = list.split(' ');
	console.log(listArray);
